# Seanpm2001 Compartmentalization

The goal of this project is to provide info and reach decisions on compartmentalizing my work. From 2021 to 2023, I have periodically been worried that my scope of technical work was too broad. In 2023 January, I came to the decision that compartmentalization will be required, with the exception that non-compartmentalized content will stay, but will not be updated further. Git may still be used as a version control system for these projects.
